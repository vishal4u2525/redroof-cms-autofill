# dam-miblock-data-poc

Automation that fills gaps in the Red Roof CMS (Milestone MiBlock/Asgard) using a RediStay
reference API as the source of truth, and DAM (Bynder/Milestone DAM) as the image source. This
file is the handoff/context doc for this project — read it fully before making any change here,
especially before running anything that writes to production.

## What this project does

For a given property code (e.g. `RRI207`), across three CMS components:

1. **`property-data`** (MiBlockId `20132`) — field `listing-page-image`: always refreshed with a
   single image (the property's exterior/hero shot).
2. **`property-level-gallery`** (MiBlockId `20133`) — field `gallery-images`, one record per tab
   (`Exterior` / `Interior` / `Rooms`): always refreshed with all matching reference-API photos for
   that category.
3. **`room-type`** (MiBlockId `20135`) — field `room-images` (+ text fields on create): for each
   room type in the reference API, either fills an existing empty CMS record's image, or creates a
   missing room-type record (text + one image).

**Everything is sourced from two read-only APIs and cross-referenced against a third (DAM) to find
the actual asset URL to write.** This project never uploads images — DAM assets must already exist.

## The APIs

| API | Purpose | Client |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/ComponentApi/GetComponentData` (`redroof.cms.milestoneinternet.info`) | Read CMS component data | `src/clients/cmsClient.js` |
| `POST /api/MiblockApi/UpdateMiblockRecordAsset` (same host) | Set asset/file fields on an **existing** record. Officially documented (see chat history / ask the team for the README if needed). Replaces the field, does not append. | `src/clients/miblockWriteClient.js` |
| `POST /api/MiblockApi/CreateComponentRecord` (same host) | Create a **new** record. **Undocumented** — only an auto-generated Swagger stub exists. Payload shape in `buildRoomTypeRecordPayload()` was reverse-engineered from a real existing record's JSON shape. Top-level `componentName` must be the **display name** (`"Room Type"`), not the alias (`"room-type"`) — the alias fails with `"Component doesn't exists"`. | `src/clients/miblockCreateClient.js` |
| `POST /web/prd/api/property/GetWebContent` (`api-gateway.redistay.com`) | Reference data (rooms, amenities, gallery, thumbnail). Requires `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header and `Device: "Web"` in the body (required field). | `src/clients/redistayClient.js` |
| `POST /api/v2.0/dam/searchassets` (`damapi.milestoneinternet.com`) | Search DAM for the real asset URL matching a reference-API filename. Read-only. | `src/clients/damClient.js` |
| `POST /api/ComponentApi/DeleteComponentRecord` (same host as CMS) | Deletes one or more records. **Undocumented**, PERMANENT (no known undo). `{ ComponentIds: "<miBlockId>", DeleteIDs: "<id1,id2,...>", SiteId: 17677 }` — both ID fields are comma-joined strings despite the singular-sounding names. | `src/clients/miblockDeleteClient.js` |
| `GET /api/ProfileAPI/Get` (same host as CMS) | Returns **every** property's Profile record in one call (`{ ProfileUnap: [...] }`), each with `ProfileId` + `PropertyCode` — this is the map used to link a room-type record to its property's Profile (see the standing rule below). No query params needed, just auth headers. Cached per-process in `profileClient.js`. | `src/clients/profileClient.js` |

### Auth

- **CMS** (`CMS_BEARER_TOKEN`): the `mscmswt` cookie value after logging into the CMS at
  `redroof.cms.milestoneinternet.info`. Also grab `ASP.NET_SessionId` → `CMS_SESSION_COOKIE`.
  Expires ~24h (`nbf`→`exp` is exactly 86400s in the JWT). `CMS_CLIENT_APP=ProgrammingApp`.
- **DAM** (`DAM_BEARER_TOKEN`): the `access_token` inside the `.Mim.Asgard.Cookie.Production`
  cookie (URL-decode it, it's a JSON blob) after logging into the Asgard app
  (`app.milestoneinternet.com`). Also ~24h expiry.
- **RediStay** (`REDISTAY_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`): static key, doesn't expire (as far as we know).
- All of these go in `.env` (gitignored). See `.env.example` for the shape.
- When a token expires, re-extract it via browser DevTools → Network tab → any authenticated
  request → `Authorization` header / cookie value. There is no programmatic login flow we know of.

## Key IDs (Red Roof site)

- CMS `SiteId`: **17677**
- DAM `BusinessId`: **7976** (`DAM_BUSINESS_ID` in `.env`)
- Component MiBlockIds: `property-data`=20132, `property-level-gallery`=20133, `room-type`=20135
  (these are shared across every property — only `RecordId`/`ParentRecordId` differ per property)

## DAM folder & filename conventions

- Each property's photos live at `red-roof/<propertycode-lowercase>/siteimages/` (e.g.
  `red-roof/rri207/siteimages/`).
- Filenames are `<property-number>-<description>[-<variant>].jpg` (e.g.
  `207-superior-king-2.jpg`). The **display name** (`name` field in DAM search results) keeps
  spaces/capitals (`"207-superior king 2.jpg"`); the **alias**/path (`alias`, last segment of
  `path`/`assetPath`) is the hyphenated, URL-safe version. **Always match on `alias`, not `name`.**
- Text-searching the property code itself (`"RRI207"`) does **not** hit the folder — but the
  **numeric part** of the code (`"207"`) does, since every filename is prefixed with it. This is
  how `listPropertyImages()` discovers a property's folder contents in one call.
- `findPropertyImageAsset(propertyCode, fileName)` in `damClient.js` does exact-alias match first,
  falls back to fuzzy token-overlap matching (threshold 0.6) scoped to that property's own images
  only, returns `null` (never guesses) if nothing clears the bar.

## Standing business rules (confirmed with the user — do not deviate without asking)

1. **`room-images`: exactly one image per room**, taken from the reference API's specific
   `RoomImageImgUrl` / `ThumbnailImage.Image.FileName` for that room — **not** all DAM variants for
   that room (we built and then explicitly reverted a "grab the whole photo family" version;
   the single-image rule is final).
2. **`listing-page-image` and `gallery-images`: always refreshed**, never skipped just because a
   value already exists (unlike `room-images`, which skips if already populated — see below).
   - **`listing-page-image` source is `ThumbnailImage.Image.FileName`** (user-confirmed 2026-08-17,
     replacing the earlier `ImageGallery[0]`; `ImageGallery[0]` remains a fallback when a property
     has no `ThumbnailImage`). **The two do not always agree** — on `HTS1437` `ThumbnailImage` is a
     jetted-tub room shot while `ImageGallery[0]` was the twilight exterior, so this change moved
     some properties' hero image from an exterior to a room.
   - **`gallery-images` source is every `ImageGallery[].Image.FileName`**, categorized.
   - In both cases the reference feed only **names** the file; the URL written is always the DAM
     asset found for that name. The feed's own `Image.Url` / `Image.otherSources.original`
     (`images.redroof.com`) **are accepted by the CMS** — verified — but using them would put part
     of the estate on a different host, so DAM stays the source of URLs.
3. **`room-images` skip-if-populated**: if an existing CMS room-type record already has ≥1 image,
   leave it alone (`skip-already-has-image`). Only empty ones get updated.
4. **Gallery categorization** (`Exterior` / `Interior` / `Rooms`) is inferred from
   `AlternateText`/`Caption` keywords (no explicit category field in the reference API) — see
   `classify()` in `galleryPlan.js`. Bathroom photos (contain "bath") → `Interior`, even if the alt
   text also mentions a room name like "Superior King" — confirmed with the user.
   - **SUPERSEDED for gallery by `damGalleryBatch.js` (user-approved 2026-08-17).** The reference
     feed proved too thin a source: it is a smaller subset than the DAM folder, and its alt-text
     frequently classified nothing as `Exterior`, leaving that tab empty on 48 properties whose DAM
     folders held exterior shots all along. `damGalleryBatch.js` sources from the DAM folder and
     categorises on the FILENAME instead. Bath-beats-room-name still holds. It also filters
     `-delete` (retired) and `sign-off` (signage) assets, strips the "HomeTowne Studios" brand token
     so a ballroom shot doesn't land in `Rooms`, and takes one image per room family before
     backfilling variants so five different room types show rather than five angles of one.
     **Applied to ~210 properties; the rest still carry reference-sourced galleries**, so the two
     sourcing methods currently coexist across the estate.
5. **Alt-text is out of scope for this automation.** `UpdateMiblockRecordAsset` only accepts URLs,
   not alt-text, so it can't be set on existing records this way. It will be added from the CMS
   side manually/separately. Don't try to solve this here.
6. **Duplicate-safety**: before creating a room-type record, check
   `createdRegistry.js` (built from `output/action-log.jsonl`) in addition to the live CMS read —
   `GetComponentData` has been observed to lag well behind CMS admin for records just created (root
   cause unknown; manually confirmed in CMS admin that the records ARE correctly parented, so it's
   a read-side lag, not a write-side bug). **Never rely on `GetComponentData` alone to decide
   "does this already exist" for something we may have just created.**
   - **This lag can get worse, not just "the newest record is missing."** On `RRI656`, after 5
     `room-type` creates + several asset updates in quick succession, `GetComponentData`'s nested
     `ChildRecords` started returning **zero** `room-type` records for that property — including
     `ND2FM`/`NR1KM`, two records that pre-existed this project and were never touched. Manually
     confirmed in CMS admin that all 7 records (old + new) are correctly present and parented — so
     this was 100% a read-side/indexing issue, not data loss, but it means a heavily-written
     property can temporarily go fully blind to this specific query, not just its newest record.
     **When you need ground truth on a property's current state (not just duplicate-avoidance),
     ask the user to check CMS admin directly rather than trusting `GetComponentData`.**
7. **RESOLVED (2026-08-17): there are no longer any duplicate `property-data` records.** There used
   to be 8 property codes with two records each (`HTS1044`, `HTS1060`, `HTS1066`, `HTS1072`,
   `RRI1082`, `RRI121`, `RRI387`, `RRI673`) — in every case the newer record (id ~172xxx) carried
   room-types but no `property-level-gallery` records at all. The user deleted all 8 duplicates in
   CMS admin; the surviving record is the older, fully-populated one. A scan of all 712 codes now
   returns exactly one `property-data` record each. Plan builders still loop over every
   `MainFilterObj` entry, which is correct and costs nothing — don't remove that.
8. **A `room-type` record MUST carry its property's Profile, or it doesn't show up correctly** (CMS
   admin's manual "Add Component Record" form has an "Advance Configuration → Select Profile" field;
   user confirmed a room type only shows in the UI once a profile is selected there). Discovered
   *after* the whole 712-property room-type wipe (see below) — every room-type record created before
   this fix landed had no Profile link and needs to be recreated.
   - **Get the ID**: `GET /api/ProfileAPI/Get` → find the entry where `PropertyCode` matches, use its
     `ProfileId` (`profileClient.js`'s `getProfileIdForPropertyCode()`).
   - **Set it on create**: two earlier guesses were wrong and confirmed wrong in CMS admin
     (`SelectedProfiles` alone on `CreateComponentRecord`; a `ProfileId` scalar + `Profile: [{ProfileID}]`
     array). The fix, confirmed working on RRI207, was capturing CMS admin's own real save request
     (a *different* endpoint, `POST /ccadmin/cms/Component/SaveComponentRecord` — admin-panel-internal,
     not `/api/MiblockApi/...`) and copying its companion fields onto our existing
     `CreateComponentRecord` call: `SelectedProfiles` **and** `PreviousAssignProfileIds` (both the
     stringified `ProfileId`), plus `MainParentComponentId` **and** `ParentComponentId` (both the
     *parent* component's MiBlockId — `20132` for a `room-type` whose parent is `property-data` —
     not the room-type's own `20135`). All four together were needed; `SelectedProfiles` alone was not
     enough. See `buildRoomTypeRecordPayload()` in `miblockCreateClient.js`.
   - The real `/ccadmin/cms/Component/SaveComponentRecord` endpoint itself was captured but never
     adopted — the user chose to keep using `CreateComponentRecord` with the borrowed fields instead.
     It's worth revisiting if another undocumented gap shows up (it appeared to accept a `RecordId`
     for an *existing* record too, which could be the missing "update text fields on an existing
     record" API this project has wanted since the alt-text/`api-unique-id` gaps — see below). Full
     headers (auth method, Content-Type, anti-forgery token) were never captured, so treat it as
     unexplored, not ruled out.

## Known gaps / open items

- **Per-image `AssetAltText`** is never set (see rule 5). Room-type records created by us do get a
  record-level `room-images-alt` **text** field (via `CreateComponentRecord`'s `RecordJsonString`),
  but that's a different, possibly-unused field from the per-image alt text nested in each
  `room-images[]` entry — unconfirmed which one the frontend actually renders. The captured
  `SaveComponentRecord` endpoint (rule 8) might be the real fix path for this too, if revisited.
- **`CreateComponentRecord` payload still has guessed fields.** Several fields in
  `buildRoomTypeRecordPayload()` (`ComponentLevel`, `Offset`, `ProfileCouponMapping`, etc.) were
  copied verbatim from an existing record with unknown purpose — they work, but "why" is unknown.
  `DisplayOrder`, `CreatedBy`/`UpdatedBy`, `StartDate`/`EndDate` are omitted entirely (left to
  server defaults) — unverified whether that's fine at scale.
- **Token expiry mid-batch** — both CMS and DAM tokens are ~24h personal-session tokens. A long
  batch run could outlive them; the batch scripts don't handle re-auth, they just fail loudly.
  Restart the batch from wherever it stopped after refreshing `.env`.
- **`GetComponentData` lags MULTIPLE HOURS for `property-data` and `property-level-gallery` — and
  the lag is total, not partial.** After the listing/gallery batch, affected records read back as if
  nothing had happened: `gallery-images` **absent from `Data` entirely** (not an empty array), and
  `updateddate` still showing `2026-07-03T07:30:20.36`, the bulk-template creation date, identical
  across unrelated properties. ~2 hours later every one of them read back correctly, with
  `updateddate` matching the write timestamp to the millisecond. **Nothing was wrong; the read was
  just hours stale.**
  - **`updateddate` is NOT a reliable freshness check here** — it is served from the same stale view
    and lags with everything else. This was learned the hard way: a whole 712-property rollout was
    wrongly declared failed on exactly that evidence, and the wrong conclusion was committed to this
    file before the reads caught up.
  - **Intermediate/partial states are visible while it catches up.** HTS1018's Interior tab was
    written with 4 images but read back as 3 mid-catch-up. Anything that reads-then-writes during
    that window will cement the partial state — a "restore what was there" step read 3, wrote 3, and
    silently dropped the 4th image. **Never round-trip (read → modify → write) these components
    without knowing the read is settled.**
  - **The lag is component-specific.** `room-type` creates and `room-images` updates made the same
    night, minutes apart, on the same token, read back immediately and correctly. Only 20132/20133
    showed the multi-hour delay.
  - **How to actually verify a batch**: wait a few hours, then re-read and compare written vs read
    counts per property. `Success: true` alone is not proof, but neither is an immediate empty read
    proof of failure — the only trustworthy check is a settled read, or CMS admin.
- **`UpdateMiblockRecordAsset` used to cap every asset field at 5 assets — LIFTED 2026-08-17.**
  Sending 6+ failed the FIELD (`"Number of AssetUrls exceeds the maximum limit of 5 for field alias
  <alias>"`, `Success: false` in `UpdateMiBlockRecordStatuses`) while the **top-level `Success`
  stayed `true`** — so a caller checking only the top-level flag recorded a success and left the tab
  empty. That silently lost **170 tabs across 159 properties**. The cap was identical (5) on
  `gallery-images`, `listing-page-image` and `room-images`, i.e. not per-field config; CMS admin
  could save more than 5 while the API refused, which is what pinned it to the API. After Milestone
  lifted it, re-verified by sending 6, 8, 12, 20, 40 and all 57 usable assets of one property to a
  single tab — every one accepted, no new ceiling found. `MAX_GALLERY_IMAGES` is now `Infinity`.
  **The lesson outlives the cap: always check the per-field statuses, never just `body.Success`.**
  **REAPPEARED 2026-08-21.** During the Amenities-category rollout (see item 10 below), the identical
  error (`"Number of AssetUrls exceeds the maximum limit of 5 for field alias gallery-images"`) came
  back on two unrelated properties (`RRI360`, `RRI479`) sending exactly 6 URLs — confirmed not
  transient by retrying the exact same call standalone a few minutes later, same failure both times.
  Root cause unknown (CMS-side regression vs. some other trigger) - **flagged to the user to raise
  with the CMS/Milestone team; automation is paused pending their answer.** Until confirmed lifted
  again, treat the cap as ACTIVE: any write of 6+ AssetUrls to `gallery-images` may fail, and code
  that removes an image from one tab to add it to another must apply the removal FIRST and only add
  to the destination on confirmed success (see item 10) - otherwise a cap failure on the removal side
  duplicates the image, since the two writes aren't atomic with each other.
- **A DAM token can die BEFORE its `exp`.** Mid-batch, 21 properties failed with
  `DAM auth failed` while the JWT still had 6.7 hours left; the API answered `401` with
  `www-authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token"`. Re-logging into Asgard appears to revoke the
  previous token. **Checking `exp` is not enough — make one live DAM call to confirm a token before
  starting a long batch.** When it happens the damage is contained: the DAM lookup runs before any
  write, so the affected properties get nothing written rather than half-written.
- **Transient failures are normal on every batch and all of them recovered on retry.** Across the
  712-property listing/gallery re-run: 21 DAM `401`s, several `fetch failed`, and several
  `No CMS property-data record found` (the documented transient-empty read). Re-running just the
  failed codes fixed every one. **Treat "re-run the failures" as a required step of any batch, not
  an exception.**
- **`skip-no-cms-record` is not proof a record is missing.** `GetComponentData` can return a
  property record with an empty `ChildRecords` list, then return the same record minutes later with
  all its children. TRC1210 read as having zero `property-level-gallery` records twice, which is why
  the batch skipped all three of its tabs — a full re-scan showed all three present the whole time.
  Confirm with repeated reads (they were stable across 3 reads for the genuinely-missing cases)
  before concluding a record needs creating.
- **The whole read can go down estate-wide, and it lies on the way back up.** Mid-way through an
  Amenities batch on 2026-08-21, `GetComponentData` began answering `HTTP 200` with `TotalCount: 0`
  for **every** property — filtered or unfiltered, authed or not — and CMS admin showed nothing
  either, so it was a CMS-side outage, not this project's request or token. 60 properties in that
  slice reported `No CMS property-data record found`; all 60 were fine and processed cleanly once
  the read returned. Worse, **during recovery it briefly returned a record that does not exist**:
  `RRI207` came back with `TotalCount: 2` (ids `139384` + `223480`), and a scan of all 712 minutes
  later found `223480` nowhere and zero duplicates estate-wide. **Never act on an extra record
  during or just after an outage** — deleting the "duplicate" could have destroyed a real one.
  Confirm any structural conclusion with repeated reads once the estate reads clean.
- **`UpdateMiblockRecordAsset` can store FEWER assets than it accepted.** On `RRI360`'s Interior
  (record `144041`) a 4-URL payload returned field-level `Success: true` twice, and both times only
  2 of the 4 were stored — `360-lobby-2.jpg` and `360-breakfast.jpg` never persisted, while the
  other two did. All four are real assets in the same DAM folder with structurally identical URLs,
  and reads were verified stable at the time (712-property scan clean). Distinct from the 5-asset
  cap (only 4 were sent) and from read lag. Cause unknown. **After any multi-asset write that
  matters, read the field back and compare counts.**
- **An asset field can come back as the literal STRING `"[]"`, not an array.** `gallery-images`,
  `room-images` and `listing-page-image` arrive in three shapes: a real array, the key absent, or
  the string `"[]"` (seen on `RRI1280` and `RRI1397`'s Exterior tab). `value || []` lets the string
  through because it is truthy, and then it fails two different ways: `.filter()`/`.map()` throw
  (`"images.filter is not a function"` killed `RRI1280` mid-batch), and **`.length` silently returns
  2, so an EMPTY tab reports two images** — which is how the inventory report came to claim RRI1280
  had 2 Exterior images when it had none. Always go through `asArray()` in `src/asArray.js`; the
  crash is loud but the miscount is not.
- **Leading-zero property codes have no DAM folder at all** — e.g. `RRI030`'s photos are not at
  `red-roof/rri030/siteimages/`, and no `rri30`-without-the-zero folder exists either (verified by
  scanning 500 assets for both spellings). Text-searching `"030"` *does* return hits, but they're
  `hts1030` files matching on substring — the path filter in `listPropertyImages()` correctly
  rejects them, so no wrong image is ever written; those properties just get records with no image.
  **64 of the 712 codes are leading-zero**, and they account for the bulk of the 530 unmatched
  gallery images (79 properties). This is a DAM content gap, not a matcher bug — once the photos are
  uploaded, re-running `listingGalleryBatch.js` will fill them in (it's update-only).
- **`GetComponentData` can transiently return empty results under load, not just lag on recent
  writes** — a 500-property batch (concurrency 5) saw ~43% of properties come back with `TotalCount:
  0` / no `MainFilterObj`, and every single one succeeded on retry. Root cause unconfirmed (backend
  load, not real absence). All batch scripts (`deleteAllRoomTypesBatch.js`,
  `recreateAllRoomTypesBatch.js`) now retry up to 3x with backoff before concluding "no property
  record" — don't remove that without re-confirming the underlying issue is gone.

## Logs (property-code-wise, durable, append-only)

- `output/action-log.jsonl` — every `createComponentRecord` / `updateMiblockRecordAsset` /
  `deleteComponentRecord` call ever made, with the full request and response. This is the audit
  trail **and** the duplicate-safety registry (`createdRegistry.js` reads it — also exposes
  `loadCreatedRecordIdsForParent()`, used to build a complete delete-target list that a lagging read
  API might otherwise miss records from). Never delete or hand-edit this file.
- `output/no-image-matches.jsonl` — every case where a reference-API image had no DAM match, with
  `propertyCode`, `component` (`room-images`/`listing-page-image`/`gallery-images`), `identifier`
  (room code or gallery category), `fileName`, `reason`. Run
  `summarizeNoMatchesByProperty()` (`src/noMatchLog.js`) to regenerate
  `output/no-image-matches-by-property.json`.
- `output/no-reference-data.jsonl` — properties where RediStay's `GetWebContent` returned no
  `RoomDetails` at all (nothing to create room-types from). `summarizeNoReferenceDataByProperty()`
  (`src/noReferenceDataLog.js`) → `output/no-reference-data-by-property.json`.
- `output/completed-properties.jsonl` — simple processed/not-processed progress tracker across batch
  runs (property code + outcome status + timestamp), separate from the full-detail master files
  below. `summarizeCompletedProperties()` (`src/completedPropertiesLog.js`) →
  `output/completed-properties-list.json`.
- `output/deleted-room-types-by-property.json`, `output/recreated-room-types-by-property.json` and
  `output/listing-gallery-by-property.json` — running, property-code-keyed master summaries written
  directly by `deleteAllRoomTypesBatch.js`, `recreateAllRoomTypesBatch.js` and
  `listingGalleryBatch.js` respectively (merge-on-write, not append-only like the `.jsonl` logs).
  - **Caveat**: a property fixed by a one-off single-property re-run (rather than by a batch) will
    still show its old `error` status here, because those re-runs deliberately skip the master-file
    rewrite to avoid clobbering a concurrently running batch. `action-log.jsonl` and
    `completed-properties.jsonl` are the truth for those. Known stale entries: `RRI1110`, `RRI1111`,
    `RRI111`, `RRI403`, `RRI404` — all five are actually fixed.

                                        BEFORE the Amenities add so a failed shrink never duplicates an
                                        image (item 10). Writes output/amenities-gallery-batch-*.json +

                                        CREATING is reported, never created, because creates are
                                        permanent and need the rule-8 Profile wiring. This is the

## Current rollout status (update this section as batches complete)

1. **All 712 properties' `room-type` records were deleted** (`deleteAllRoomTypesBatch.js`, 3 batches:
   0–100, 100–600, 600–712) — 1282 records removed, 0 errors, 0 unresolved "no property record" cases
   (all initial "missing" ones were the transient-empty-response issue above, confirmed via retry).
2. **Room-type recreation is COMPLETE for all 712** (`recreateAllRoomTypesBatch.js`), with Profile
   linking on every record. Batch `0–100` was done in a separate session (99 OK, `HTS1031` has no
   RediStay room data). Batches `100–200`, `200–600`, `600–712` were run here: **~4,100 rooms
   created, ~3,780 images linked (~92%)**, plus 7 `no-reference-rooms` properties (RediStay returns
   no `RoomDetails` — not an error).
   - 5 properties errored mid-batch on transient network/JSON faults and were left **partially
     populated** (some rooms created, rest missing). All 5 were re-run individually and verified to
     match their reference room count exactly: `RRI1110`, `RRI1111`, `RRI111`, `RRI403`, `RRI404`.
     **A mid-property failure always leaves a partial property — re-run that property, don't assume
     the batch's per-property status is atomic.**
3. **`listing-page-image` + `property-level-gallery` are COMPLETE for all 712**
   (`listingGalleryBatch.js`, batches 0–50, 50–150, 150–300, 300–500, 500–712): **712 OK, 0 errors,
   642 listing images set, 1,653 gallery tabs filled, 4,705 gallery images linked.** Verified by
   reading records back ~2h later: written count matches read count property by property.
   - **For ~2 hours after the writes, `GetComponentData` showed all of this as empty**, which looks
     exactly like total failure. See the read-lag gap below before concluding a batch did nothing.
   - Properties that legitimately got nothing (`skip-no-dam-image-match`) are a separate DAM content
     gap, not a write problem — see the leading-zero entry below.
4. **Gallery re-filled from DAM on ~210 properties** (`damGalleryBatch.js`): the 155 whose tabs the
   5-asset limit had silently emptied, then 49 more whose `Exterior` tab was empty despite DAM
   holding exterior shots, plus a handful of one-offs. All landed, 0 errors.
5. **Verified end state (full re-read of all 712 on 2026-08-17):** 642 properties have images;
   70 are completely empty (62 have no DAM folder, 8 get no `ImageGallery` from RediStay); 3 are
   partially empty (`RRI635` has 30 DAM photos but none exterior, `RRI553` has one bathroom photo,
   `RRI019` has listing images but no DAM folder). **Nothing is left that automation can fix** —
   every remaining gap needs photos uploaded to DAM or room data added in RediStay.
   Cross-checking written-vs-read found **zero** properties where a write did not land.
   Report: `output/image-zero-report.csv`, `output/full-diagnosis.json`.
6. **4th gallery category (`Amenities`) rollout COMPLETE for all 712** (`amenitiesGalleryBatch.js`,
   slices 200-300 through 700-712 run here on top of Jainil's 0-200). Pool / fitness / business
   centre / vending / laundry / meeting-room images moved out of Exterior/Interior/Rooms into their
   own tab, shrink-first so a failure can never duplicate. **530 properties now carry an Amenities
   record holding 889 images**; 182 had nothing to move.
   - The 5-asset cap **was lifted again** before this run (re-verified live on `RRI360`/`RRI479`,
     the two properties whose cap failures had paused the rollout). Both then turned out fine
     without the paused fix script - `fixRRI360RRI479.js` is now stale and should not be run: its
     RRI360 step deletes an Amenities record that no longer exists, and RRI479 resolved itself.
7. **Verified end state (full 4-tab re-read of all 712, 2026-08-22):** listing images 712/712;
   gallery 6,609 images (Exterior 921, Interior 2,102, Amenities 889, Rooms 2,697); room images
   4,598 of 4,614. **15 properties carry a gap**: 8 get no `RoomDetails` from RediStay so they have
   no room-type records at all (their galleries are full), and 7 have some rooms without an image.
   Reports: `reports/image-inventory.md`, `output/consolidated-report.csv`,
   `output/consolidated-rooms.csv`.
8. **Total audit trail: 10,520 write calls, zero `Success: false`, zero corrupt log lines.**
9. **Known unverified item**: on `HTS1030` all 4 writes returned `Success: true`, but
   `GetComponentData` still read back empty on two separate re-reads minutes apart. Consistent with
   the documented read-lag (rule 6) and with the fact that no write in 10,520 calls was rejected —
   but **not confirmed in CMS admin**. Worth a spot-check.
10. Branches: work happens on `jainil-develop` and `vishal-develop`; **`main` is not touched**, per
   explicit instruction. `output/` is gitignored, so each person's progress files aren't visible to
   the other — share status separately before assuming a range is untouched.
11. **Strict 3-node accuracy audit (2026-08-19) — done, near-100%, 2 items need a human.** The user
   tightened the spec: every image must trace to one exact reference field — `listing-page-image` <-
   `ThumbnailImage.Image.FileName`, `gallery-images` (3 tabs) <- `ImageGallery[].Image.FileName`,
   `room-images` <- `RoomDetails[].ThumbnailImage.Image.FileName`. Built `verifyImageAccuracy.js` /
   `verifyImageAccuracyBatch.js` (a live 712-property audit) plus a Jest suite (`npm test` = fast
   unit tests on the matching logic, no network; `npm run test:live` = the gated full live audit).
   - First run: 704/712 clean, 92 flagged "mismatches". On inspection, only **2 were real wrong-image
     bugs** (`RRI296`, `RRI662` — stale listing images, now fixed). Everything else was one of two
     non-bug categories:
     - **48 gallery images (~20 properties)**: real, correct photos that are DAM-folder-sourced
       (rule 4) rather than literally named in `ImageGallery[]` — because for that specific
       property+tab, the reference feed has ZERO images in that category at all.
       `UpdateMiblockRecordAsset` requires ≥1 non-blank `AssetUrl`, so a tab with nothing to trace to
       can be left alone but never forced empty through this API. **Accepted as a permanent gap, not
       a bug** — there is nothing valid to replace those images with.
     - **41 room "mismatches`**: all `actual: null` (no image at all, never a wrong one). Root cause:
       RediStay points many rooms at its own generic "no real photo" placeholder filenames
       (`Red-Roof-Inn-Default-Room-Image-2-Beds.jpg`, `...-1-Bed.jpg`,
       `Images-Not-Available-Placeholder-RRI-S.png`) that were never uploaded to DAM. The user
       uploaded the 2-Beds + listing placeholders to a **shared, non-property DAM folder**
       (`red-roof/site-images/`) — needed a new `findSharedAsset()` in `damClient.js` since the
       normal property-scoped search can't see outside one property's own folder. A generic
       single-bed photo (`red-roof/other-images/rri-default-room-image.jpg`) stood in for the
       never-uploaded "1-Bed" default. `fixDefaultRoomImages.js` applied that to 12 rooms.
   - **2 items still pending, need a human, not more code:**
     1. 4 room photos (`RRI121` x3, `RRI148` x1) need their own real, specific, unique photo
        uploaded to DAM — see `output/fix-accuracy-issues-result.json`'s `still-no-dam-match`
        entries for the exact expected filenames. A generic default would be wrong for these
        (their reference filenames are one-off, not a shared placeholder name).
     2. 8 properties (`HTS1031`, `RRI079`, `RRI1272`, `RRI1279`, `RRI1426`, `RRI455`, `RRI905`,
        `TRC1415`) have **zero data in RediStay's reference API** — confirmed via direct call,
        response is `NoDataReturnedError`/`NoResultsError` from RediStay's own SDL API, not a DAM or
        CMS-side issue. Their `listing-page-image`/`property-level-gallery` already have real images
        from the phase above; only `room-type` is empty (0 records — correctly, since there's no
        reference data to create rooms from). Needs RediStay's own data team, not this project.
   - Also found/fixed a real bug in the audit script: `gallery-images`/`room-images` occasionally
     comes back as the literal **string** `"[]"` instead of a real array, crashing a naive `.map()`.
     See `asArray()` in `verifyImageAccuracy.js` — defend against this in any new code that reads
     these fields.
12. **4th gallery category "Amenities" (2026-08-21) — IN PROGRESS, paused pending a CMS-side answer.**
    Client added a 4th `property-level-gallery` tab alongside Exterior/Interior/Rooms, with their own
    examples: Exterior includes pet area/fire pit/EV charging; Interior includes lobby/breakfast;
    Amenities covers pool, fitness center, business center, vending, laundry, meeting rooms.
    - **New CMS record type discovered working**: `property-level-gallery` records CAN be created via
      `CreateComponentRecord` the same way `room-type` records are — Profile-linked (`SelectedProfiles`
      + `PreviousAssignProfileIds`, same per-property `ProfileId` as room-type) with
      `MainParentComponentId`/`ParentComponentId` = `20132` (property-data, the actual parent) and
      `ComponentName`/top-level `componentName` = `"Property-Level-Gallery"` (display name, not the
      alias — same alias-fails gotcha as room-type). `gallery-tab-name` is a free-text field, not a
      CMS-side enum — confirmed via screenshot of the admin "Add Component Record" form, so no
      CMS-admin-side setup was needed before creating "Amenities" tabs by API.
    - **Approach is surgical, not a rebuild**: `galleryPlan4.js`'s `buildAmenitiesMovePlan()` only
      moves images that are CURRENTLY SITTING in a property's Exterior/Interior/Rooms tab AND whose
      RediStay reference-feed entry (`Image.AlternateText` + `Caption`) classifies as Amenities — it
      never rebuilds those 3 tabs wholesale from the reference feed, which would have undone the
      DAM-folder-based fix already applied to ~210 properties (rule 4's `damGalleryBatch.js`, thinner
      reference-feed subset). Classification is deliberately sourced from the reference feed (not DAM
      filenames), per explicit instruction — it catches things a filename never would, e.g. a photo
      literally named `...Snack-Center...` whose `AlternateText` says `"...Vending Image"`.
    - **Three real bugs found and fixed live during the rollout**, in order:
      1. Moving the ONLY amenity-classified image out of a tab left it with 0 remaining -
         `UpdateMiblockRecordAsset` rejects an empty `AssetUrls` list, so the shrink write failed
         while the separate Amenities-add write still succeeded, duplicating the image in both
         places. Hit on `HTS1298`/`HTS1284` in the first 0–100 pilot (fixed by hand: delete the
         Amenities record if it would end up empty, otherwise strip the duplicate back out). Code fix:
         never let a shrink's move-set equal the tab's full image count — always keep >= 1 behind.
      2. `\bpool\b`-style keyword matching broke two ways at once: a bare `pool` substring matched
         "Poolside" inside ROOM captions (`"Superior King Poolside Non-Smoking"`), wrongly
         reclassifying 4 room photos on `RRI479`; fixing that with `\b` boundaries then broke
         legitimate matches on underscore-joined `AlternateText` (`"HTS1022_Laundry PRO Approved
         Image"`) because JS regex treats `_` as a `\w` character, so `\blaundry\b` found no boundary
         after `_`. Final fix: normalize `_`/`-` to spaces before running the `\b` keyword regexes.
         Re-audited every already-moved image against the fixed classifier after each fix
         (`verifyAmenitiesFalsePositives.js`) — first pass found 18 false positives (17 were the
         underscore bug, re-checked clean after fix 2; 1 was the genuine poolside case on `RRI479`).
      3. The shrink-then-add sequence itself wasn't atomic: if the shrink write failed for ANY reason
         (bug 1, or the cap below) but the separate Amenities-add succeeded anyway, the image
         duplicated again. Fixed in `amenitiesGalleryBatch.js`: shrinks now run FIRST, and only images
         whose shrink call actually returned `Success: true` are included in the Amenities
         create/update payload — a failed shrink now just leaves that image where it already was.
    - **The lifted 5-asset-per-field cap (see Known gaps) reappeared live** on `RRI360` and `RRI479`
      (both sending exactly 6 URLs), confirmed non-transient by retry. **Paused the batch rollout here
      pending the user raising it with the CMS/Milestone team** — do not resume mass-applying until
      either the cap is confirmed lifted again or a decision is made on how to handle >5-image tabs.
    - **Rollout progress so far**: property-codes.json indices 0–100 (0–100 batch + retries), 100–200,
      and a partial slice of 200–300 (stopped mid-run at user request, ~360/612 of the earlier
      combined 100–712 background attempt before it was also stopped and restarted in 100-batches) have
      been processed. Remaining: most of 200–300 onward through 712. `output/amenities-gallery-by-
      property.json` is the running master log (same merge-on-write pattern as the other batch
      scripts) — but note a batch stopped mid-run via `TaskStop` never reaches its own `writeFile` call,
      so that slice's entries are missing from the master log even though the live CMS writes already
      happened (real writes are per-call, not deferred to the end) — cross-check `action-log.jsonl` for
      ground truth on anything stopped mid-run, don't trust the master JSON's completeness alone.
    - **Two properties need manual follow-up once the cap question is resolved**: `RRI360` (Amenities
      record deleted rather than left duplicated — Interior's 3 amenity images are still sitting there
      un-moved, `144041`) and `RRI479` (4 room photos — `superior-king-5`, `vanity-bath-4`,
      `2-full-beds`, `standard-king` — are currently in NEITHER Exterior nor Amenities, pending a write
      of 6 total URLs to Exterior `148147` that the cap currently blocks; Amenities `223852` itself is
      already correctly populated with just `pool` + `guest-laundry`).

## How to run things

# Room-type plan for one property (read-only)
node src/analyze.js RRI207

# Room-type plan across all 712 properties (read-only)
node src/batchAnalyze.js

# Listing-image / gallery plans - no CLI yet, import and call directly:
node -e "import('./src/listingImagePlan.js').then(m => m.buildListingImagePlan('RRI207')).then(console.log)"

**Room-type rollout (writes, PERMANENT, this is the live in-progress task — see status above):**

```bash
# Recreates room-types for properties at index [start, start+size) of output/property-codes.json.
# Deletes any leftover room-type records first, then creates fresh from RediStay + links one DAM
# image each, with Profile linking. Prints a per-batch summary and updates
# output/recreated-room-types-by-property.json + output/completed-properties-list.json.
node src/recreateAllRoomTypesBatch.js <startIndex> <batchSize>

# e.g. to continue after 0-100 is done:
node src/recreateAllRoomTypesBatch.js 100 500
node src/recreateAllRoomTypesBatch.js 600 112
```

Check the printed summary's `Errors` count after every batch before moving to the next slice. If a
property comes back `no-property-record`, that was historically a transient `GetComponentData`
issue (see Known gaps) already retried 3x internally — if it's still failing after a fresh
manual re-check, something's actually wrong, don't just re-run blindly.

**Listing-image + gallery rollout (writes, update-only — safe to re-run):**

```bash
# Applies listing-page-image and all 3 property-level-gallery tabs for a slice.
# Both fields are always-refresh (rule 2), so this only ever calls
# updateMiblockRecordAsset - no creates, no deletes, nothing permanent.
node src/listingGalleryBatch.js <startIndex> <batchSize>
```

## Working agreement with the user (important)

- **Never call a write API (`updateMiblockRecordAsset`, `createComponentRecord`) without the
  user's explicit go-ahead for that specific action.** This was raised firmly once already in this
  project — re-read that as: confirm scope before executing, don't chain extra writes onto an
  approved one.
- Production only, no staging environment is in use for this project.
- Prefer small, reviewable batches over large blind runs.
